    "description": "Goblu is a Boss in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that has long red hair with three painted masks in the middle. It primarily uses its limbs to attack and perform combos. During the fight, Goblu grows multiple flowers that allow it to generate shields. Goblu is a mandatory Main Story Boss. Some players speculate that Goblu might be Maelle's plushie, as Maelle remarks before the fight that he seems familiar to her, and he shares a visual resemblance to Esquie and Francois. A chromatic variant, 'Chromatic Goblu,' also exists.",
    "tips": "Goblu is weak to Lightning Damage - use Gustave's Overcharge or Lune's Thunderfall. Stacking Burn is also effective. Destroy flowers by shooting them (immune to AoE). Blue flowers grant shields, red flowers grant damage buff - prioritize shooting red flowers. For the Jump Attack, parry right as Goblu's butt hits the ground. Reach Level 10 before attempting. Turn off Automatic QTEs for more damage.",
